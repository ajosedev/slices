# Slices

Converts a JSON-like schema into a React page.

A proof of concept for now, but will gradually build features to turn it into more a CMS experience.

## TODO

- Add base styling to make everything pretty
- Deploy site, SSR, etc
- More components - quote
- Add styling props to components - e.g. bold, size, etc.
- Allow components to be re-ordered
