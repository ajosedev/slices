# Slices

Converts JSON into a React page.

A proof of concept for now, but will gradually build features to turn it into more a CMS experience.

## TODO

- Split screen view where JSON is on the left and it makes page on the right
- More components - grid, quote
- Add styling props to components - e.g. bold, size, etc.
- Add base styling to make everything pretty
- New view that abstracts the JSON
  - i.e. adding components and moving inputs around rather than JSON
