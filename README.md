# Slices

Converts JSON into a React page.

A proof of concept for now, but will gradually build features to turn it into more a CMS experience.

## TODO

- More components - image, quote
- Split screen view where JSON is on the left and it makes page on the right
- New view that abstracts the JSON
  - i.e. adding components and moving inputs around rather than JSON
