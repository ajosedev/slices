# Slices

Converts JSON into a React page.

A proof of concept for now, but will gradually build features to turn it into more a CMS experience.

## TODO

- New view that abstracts the JSON
  - i.e. adding components and moving inputs around rather than JSON
  - make select for choosing which component to add
    - shows different form inputs depending on the component
    - have to figure out how to populate form that matches props
      - ideally form has selects, text inputs, etc.
- Add base styling to make everything pretty
- Deploy site, SSR, etc
- More components - quote
- Add styling props to components - e.g. bold, size, etc.
